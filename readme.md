## Description

FE 3 builds further on the knowledge acquired in **Internetstandaarden** and
**Inleiding Programmeren** (year 1), **FE 1** (year 2), and **FE 2** and
**Backend** (year 2, optional but recommended), amongst others.

In this course you’ll learn:

1.  If you prefer design, to use d3 to actually make what you envision
2.  If you prefer development, to advance your web dev skills and to adopt
    frameworks and libraries
3.  …or both!

If you’d like to go even further with web development, do check out the
[Minor Web Development][minor]. Both [**@wooorm**][wooorm-gh] and
[**@razpudding**][razpudding-gh] lecture in the minor, so feel free to ask
them for more information.

## Goals

The 3 main goals in this course are:

*   Learning how to use a library
*   Making a datavisualisation from external data
*   Learning d3

In practice, you’ll learn to:

*   Read documentation
*   Write documentation (for code and projects)
*   Debug code (such as adapting d3 v3 code to v4)
*   Rewrite code in your own style
*   Read in external data
*   Use dataformats (like JSON, CSV, TSV, and more.)
*   Transform and clean external data
*   Understand the d3 update loop (enter, update, exit)
*   Create multiple graphs on the same page
*   Create interactive visualisations (think filter, sort, and zoom)
*   Use axes, scales, labels
*   Understand SVG, canvas

## Environment

FE 3 is a course given in the optional [Information Design][moodle-id] semester
(quarter 1 and 2), a semester all about data visualisation and infographics.

In 6 courses and 3 projects you’ll learn how to visualise data and complex
information. In this course you’ll learn how to build that.

This semester, including this course, is quite technical. However, we’ll also
test your creativity and research & concepting capabilities.

See the below infographic on where FE 3 is placed in Information Design.
